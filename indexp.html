        <h3 class="title">Why do we love perfumes?</h3>
        <p>Scent has no personal significance until it is associated with something that has meaning. That is why we can
            never forget the scent of a former lover years later or the way you felt when you were wearing a particular
            perfume. The name of my new fragrance, Remember When pulls from the phenomenon that our memory's muse is
            scent.
            We naturally tie scents to memories without having to do anything, but experience of the moment.</p>
        <h5 class="title">It makes us do crazy things</h5>
        <p>True story, I was at the mall a few months ago and an older gentleman wearing an exotic aquatic cologne
            walked
            past me and I found myself unconsciously tailing him in the store just enjoying his scent. HAHA! I know what
            you're thinking -CREEPER! But that is how our mind and body react to scent. Pheromones are scent triggered
            hormones that stimulate our sexual appetite. Not to get too scientific but all that means is there is a
            strong
            attraction that takes place when perfume or cologne arrives on the scene.</p>
        <h5 class="title">The way it makes us feel on the inside</h5>
        <p>We all at times need an escape from the craziness that is called life. Fragrances (therapeutic or not) can
            relieve stress and take you to a place of rest and peace.</p>
        <h5 class="title">Shows off our individuality</h5>
        <p> There are thousands of perfumes on the market to select that when you eventually choose one, your pick is
            truly
            original. And the best part? You don't have to limit yourself to just one, you can match the way you smell
            to
            your mood, or the occasion. One day you can smell like lavender and the next day like jasmine and musk.
            I heard at a conference that fragrance has the ability to make us feel desired. And that person is right, in
            my
            opinion scent is an internal weapon with positive benefits!
